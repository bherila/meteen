<p align="justify">&quot;I needed an edge,&quot; said senior Miguel Padilla, one of the two students released on a $5,000 bond last Thursday on charges of cruelty to animals. Padilla's actions have not only led to an ethical debate on the use of live cats in high school classrooms, but also raised questions on how far today's youth are willing to go to get their academic &quot;edge&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify">Nancy Meyers, the two boys' Biology II teacher at Arcadia High School, was not immediately available to comment. </p>
<p align="justify">&quot;It's sick to see what lengths students will go in order to compete for grades in [high] school,&quot; says Scottsdale School District Superintendent Diane Cummings, &quot;[this] drive for academic supremecy has escalated into harming a local family's pet.&quot; </p>
<p align="justify">Padilla, along with classmate Brad Fuerte, used scalpels taken from Arcadia's science lab. No charges for theft have been filed yet by the school district. </p>
<p align="justify">The mutilated cat was spotted by residents in Padilla's apartment complex when the boys alledgedly &quot;tossed the cat carcus over the second-story balcony&quot; landing it into a public gathering area. On-looking residents called law enforecement.</p>
<p align="justify">In Arizona, animal cruelty charges have a maximum of $150,000 fine and up to 2 years in prison. The two boys, in accordance with their school district's Student Code of Conduct, have been suspended for 10 days awaiting an expulsion hearing. </p>
