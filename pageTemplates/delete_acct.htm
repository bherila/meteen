<p>What's that, you say? You want to delete your account? Well, you can't. Why not, you ask? The answer is rather simple, yet complicated nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>Can you delete a person from existence?</strong> <br>
While perhaps you could in <em>1984</em>, such an action can't be done in the real world, nor can it be done on MeTeen. Your account on MeTeen is essentially your identity; MeTeen is a living, growing organism, in a sense. A micro-world, an ecosystem, a planet - whatever you want to call it. Regardless, everything people do is tied to their user account. Forum posts, profile comments, hot or not ratings - it's all connected to you in some way, and it's connected to your profile in much the same way. Deleting your account would cause your contributions to the community to disappear. And we can't have forum thread replies on a topic that doesn't exist any more, nor can we have profile comments made by an extinct user. </p>
<p><strong>So what should I do with my account?<br>
</strong>If you don't want to use MeTeen anymore, just stop using your account. As your profile ages, it will eventually fall back on the listings and be forgotten. Your comments will go farther into the past, along with your forum posts. Since you may still appear at random on Hot or Not, you can at the very least delete your picture to prevent this from happening. You may also receive e-mails from MeTeen from time to time. If you no longer wish to receive these, you will need to unsubscribe separately from the MeTeen mailing list by clicking the unsubscribe link in one of the e-mails.</p>
<p><strong>I don't want my account any more, so can't I just break the terms of service and force you to delete it?<br>
</strong>You could break the terms, but we still won't delete your account. The first few times, we'll just remove the offending content. If you persist, we'll disable access to your account. But it will still be there, and there will be nothing you can do about it. You would be better off to just abandon your account, so you can at least have access to it at a later time. Besides, breaking the terms isn't very nice. It's there to make everyone happy.</p>
<p><em><strong>The verdict - if you abandon your account, it's almost as good as actually deleting it. Just as people who are gone for a long time are eventually forgotten, you can make yourself become forgotten by simply not coming back to the site. We're sorry to see you go.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>And, if you really are going to leave,<br>
<em>Please tell us how we could make MeTeen better! Send your comments to <a href="mailto:feedback@meteen.com">feedback@meteen.com</a>. We'll probably respond, but please understand that we might not be able to in all situations. </em></strong></p>
